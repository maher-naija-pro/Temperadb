# TimeSeriesDB Server Shutdown Testing

This document describes the comprehensive testing implemented for the TimeSeriesDB server shutdown functionality.

## Overview

The TimeSeriesDB server implements a robust graceful shutdown mechanism that ensures:
- All active connections are properly closed
- Storage connections are cleaned up
- Metrics are updated
- Server status is properly managed
- Shutdown completes within configured timeouts

## Test Coverage

### Existing Tests (Fixed)
- `TestServerShutdown` - Basic shutdown functionality
- `TestServerShutdownTimeout` - Shutdown with timeout handling

### New Comprehensive Shutdown Tests

#### 1. Graceful Shutdown (`TestServerGracefulShutdown`)
- Tests server startup and graceful shutdown
- Verifies server status transitions (starting → running → shutting_down → stopped)
- Ensures proper cleanup of resources

#### 2. Shutdown with Active Connections (`TestServerShutdownWithActiveConnections`)
- Tests shutdown when server has active connections
- Simulates connection tracking
- Verifies connections are properly handled during shutdown

#### 3. Shutdown Metrics (`TestServerShutdownMetrics`)
- Tests metrics collection during shutdown
- Measures shutdown duration
- Verifies final metrics state

#### 4. Error Handling (`TestServerShutdownErrorHandling`)
- Tests shutdown on already stopped server
- Tests shutdown with nil context (returns validation error)
- Ensures proper error handling

#### 5. Race Conditions (`TestServerShutdownRaceConditions`)
- Tests concurrent shutdown calls
- Ensures thread-safe shutdown operations
- Verifies no race conditions during shutdown

#### 6. Storage Error Handling (`TestServerShutdownWithStorageErrors`)
- Tests shutdown with storage cleanup
- Ensures storage errors don't prevent successful shutdown
- Verifies proper error logging

## Server Shutdown Implementation

### Status Management
The server maintains a status field with the following values:
- `0` - stopped (initial state)
- `1` - starting
- `2` - running
- `3` - shutting_down
- `4` - stopped (final state)

### Shutdown Process
1. **Status Update**: Set status to "shutting_down"
2. **HTTP Server Shutdown**: Gracefully stop accepting new connections
3. **Storage Cleanup**: Close storage connections
4. **Metrics Update**: Record shutdown duration and errors
5. **Status Finalization**: Set status to "stopped"

### Context Handling
- Supports timeout-based shutdown via context
- Handles cancelled contexts gracefully
- Returns validation error for nil contexts

## Running the Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all server tests
make test-server

# Run specific test
go test -v -run TestServerGracefulShutdown ./internal/server/
```

### Integration Test Program
```bash
# Build the test program
go build -o bin/test_shutdown cmd/test_shutdown/main.go

# Run the shutdown test
./bin/test_shutdown
```

### Shell Script Test
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test_shutdown.sh

# Run shutdown tests
./test_shutdown.sh
```

## Test Results

All shutdown tests are currently passing:

```
=== RUN   TestServerGracefulShutdown
--- PASS: TestServerGracefulShutdown (0.10s)
=== RUN   TestServerShutdownWithActiveConnections
--- PASS: TestServerShutdownWithActiveConnections (0.10s)
=== RUN   TestServerShutdownMetrics
--- PASS: TestServerShutdownMetrics (0.10s)
=== RUN   TestServerShutdownErrorHandling
--- PASS: TestServerShutdownErrorHandling (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestServerShutdownRaceConditions
--- PASS: TestServerShutdownRaceConditions (0.10s)
=== RUN   TestServerShutdownWithStorageErrors
--- PASS: TestServerShutdownWithStorageErrors (0.10s)
```

## Key Features Tested

### 1. Graceful Shutdown
- Server stops accepting new connections
- Existing connections complete naturally
- Resources are properly cleaned up

### 2. Timeout Handling
- Shutdown completes within configured timeout
- Context cancellation is handled properly
- No hanging during shutdown

### 3. Connection Management
- Active connection counting
- Connection cleanup during shutdown
- No connection leaks

### 4. Metrics and Monitoring
- Shutdown duration tracking
- Error counting and categorization
- Status updates throughout process

### 5. Error Resilience
- Storage errors don't prevent shutdown
- Proper error logging and metrics
- Graceful degradation

## Configuration

The shutdown timeout is configurable via the main application:
- Default timeout: 30 seconds
- Configurable via context in `server.Shutdown(ctx)`
- Test timeout: 5-10 seconds for faster testing

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Non-blocking Tests**: All tests use goroutines to avoid blocking
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Tests always clean up resources
3. **Timeout Handling**: Tests have reasonable timeouts
4. **Error Verification**: Tests verify expected error conditions
5. **Status Validation**: Tests verify server state transitions
6. **Concurrent Testing**: Tests for race conditions and thread safety

## Future Enhancements

1. **Load Testing**: Test shutdown under high load
2. **Network Partitioning**: Test shutdown during network issues
3. **Storage Failures**: Test shutdown with various storage error scenarios
4. **Performance Metrics**: Measure shutdown performance under different conditions
5. **Integration Tests**: Test shutdown with real HTTP clients

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Issues
1. **Port Conflicts**: Tests use different ports to avoid conflicts
2. **Timeout Issues**: Tests have appropriate timeouts for different scenarios
3. **Resource Cleanup**: All tests properly clean up resources

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. Check server logs for error details
2. Verify port availability
3. Check system resources (file descriptors, memory)
4. Review test configuration and timeouts

## Conclusion

The TimeSeriesDB server shutdown functionality is thoroughly tested with comprehensive coverage of:
- Normal shutdown scenarios
- Error conditions
- Race conditions
- Resource cleanup
- Metrics and monitoring

All tests pass consistently, ensuring reliable server shutdown behavior in production environments.
